# Analysis-of-Steady-State-and-Transient-Diffusion-Reaction-in-1D-Membrane-Reactor
The code simulates 4 chemical reactions to analyze 1D concentration profiles of 4 chemical species diffusing in 1 direction inside membrane reactor. Steady-state and transient-state solutions were obtained using multivariable Newton and implicit Euler methods, respectively.
